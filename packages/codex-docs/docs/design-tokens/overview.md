# Design tokens

**Design tokens are the smallest stylistic pieces of our design system**.

We use tokens:
- To maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for user-interface (UI) development in a
  single source of truth instead of hard-coded style values or single-use variables
- To ensure that only systematic decisions are used to style components and features

Tokens can be used in several formats: CSS custom properties, Less variables, SCSS variables, and JSON files.

Each token category has a demo page where you can see each token's name and value, a demo of the
token, and information about where the token value comes from.

## Using design tokens

### Figma

Enable the [Codex design tokens Figma library](https://www.figma.com/file/mRvSsFD2Kwh8AZNjlx7rIl/%E2%9C%A8-Design-Tokens-%5BWIP%5D?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)
in your Figma projects to use all the design tokens that were translated into Figma styles.

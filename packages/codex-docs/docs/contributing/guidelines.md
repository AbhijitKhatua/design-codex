# Contributing guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone! There are several ways to contribute:

- Adding or commenting on tasks in our project management system, Phabricator (links below)
- Contributing to the design process
- Suggesting new components and design tokens
- Writing and submitting code
- Reviewing code
- Updating and expanding library documentation

Contributions to Codex are covered by the [Code of Conduct for Wikimedia technical spaces](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Code_of_Conduct).

## How to stay up-to-date

Consider following Codex design, development, roadmaps, and releases in these places:

- [Phabricator](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/design-systems-team/): used to track the
  work, and allows others the opportunity to subscribe to tasks, add comments, and claim tasks.
  [Learn more about the use of Phabricator at the Wikimedia Foundation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Phabricator/Project_management).
- [Team page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Design_Systems_Team): used to share information about
  the Design Systems Team's mission, vision, work streams, objectives/key results (OKRs), and
  roadmap.
- Mailing lists: used to share release notes and summaries for major and minor releases:
  - Wikimedia tech news mailing list ([wikitech-l](https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/wikitech-l.lists.wikimedia.org/))
  - Wikimedia design mailing list ([design.public](https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/design.lists.wikimedia.org/))
- [ADRs section](/adrs/overview): used to document technical decisions about the library.

## Task tracking

Tasks are tracked in Phabricator. We use three different Phabricator workboards, for three different purposes:

- [Codex](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/codex/): used to indicate that a task is related to
  Codex. We do not track task status here.
- [Design-Systems-Team](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/design-systems-team/): used to
  triage, sort, prioritize, and refine tasks that the Design Systems team and contributors will
  work on. 
- [Design-Systems-Sprint](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/view/5859/): used to track
  active works-in-progress from Research > Design > Development > Testing > Release. As a
  contributor, you are welcome to track your work related to the Design System on this board as
  well—just remember to keep the task in the appropriate column that reflects its status.

> I want to know the status of something

Check the [Codex](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/codex/),
[Design-Systems-Team](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/design-systems-team/), and
[Design-Systems-Sprint](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/view/5859/) workboards in
Phabricator to see if a task exists for that work (for detailed Phabricator search tips, visit
[this page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Phabricator/Help?tableofcontents=0#Searching_for_items)).
If so, the task will be in the column that represents its current status. If not, you can
create a task (see below) or contact us (see the
[Design Systems Team page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Design_Systems_Team) on mediawiki.org)

> I want to request a feature

You are welcome to create new tasks with the #Codex and #Design-Systems-Team tags. New tasks will
go into our "Needs Triage (Incoming Requests)" column and will be triaged regularly. Please remember
that Codex is maintained by a nonprofit—we won't be able to meet all feature requests, and it might
take time to get to your request.


> I want to follow parts of your work

[Create a Phabricator account](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Phabricator/Help#Creating_your_account)
and add yourself as a subscriber to a task to get notified when updates are made.

> I want to contribute to a task

Great! Create or claim a task as soon as you decide to work on it. This will help avoid overlapping,
duplicate, or conflicting work. If you're creating a task, add as much detail as you can about the
scope of the task: for example, what needs to be completed before the task can be considered "done"?

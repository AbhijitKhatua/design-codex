# Overview

The Wikimedia Codex Design Style Guide ensures a consistent look and behavior for our products.
Our interfaces are our brand.

These principles and guidelines aim to help designers and developers with their [Wikimedia](https://www.wikimedia.org/)
projects, as part of the [Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/) or in a volunteer capacity.

The style guide features unique focus areas like accessibility, internationalization, and localization.

## Our process

The [Wikimedia Foundation Design Team](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Design) maintains the style
guide.

Our multi-disciplinary team focuses on user experience design, user research, engineering, information architecture, human-computer interaction, and visual design.

We follow design principles to provide solutions for visual identity, [user interface components](./../components/overview),
and patterns.

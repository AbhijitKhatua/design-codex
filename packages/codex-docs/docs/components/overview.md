# Components

Components are the interactive building blocks of our design system, used to create consistent and powerful user interfaces.

The Codex library contains fully interactive components built with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/). Some
components are also available in a CSS-only version for use in no-JavaScript contexts.

Each component in Codex has a demo page where you can interact with working examples, see code samples, and read detailed usage information about the Vue and CSS-only implementations.

## Component roadmap

If you want to learn more about the components we plan to add to Codex in the future, read about
[Codex planned components on mediawiki.org](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Design_Systems_Team/Codex_Planned_Components).

// Add components that are still in development to this file, as follows:
// import CdxComponentName from './component-name/ComponentName.vue';
//
// export {
//     CdxComponentName
// };

// This export default is needed to prevent Jest from failing with
// "Coverage data for src/components-wip was not found". When adding a new component here, you
// should CHANGE THIS to "export", removing the "default". See also the import+export example above.
export default {
};

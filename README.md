# Codex

Codex is a toolkit for building user interfaces within the Wikimedia Design System. Codex contains
three packages:

- **Design tokens**: for writing styles consistent with the [Wikimedia Design Style Guide](https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/components/links.html) 
- **Vue 3 components**: for building usable, accessible, translatable [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
  applications
- **Vitepress site**: for documentation, Vue component demos, and design token visualization

Codex features:
- Wide-ranging support for internationalization and global usage
- Web accessibility baked in
- Comprehensive browser and device support
